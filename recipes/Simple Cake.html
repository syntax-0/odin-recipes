    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cake has an impressively well-risen deep sponge, 
        flecked with soft orange peel, 
        and using the whole clementine gives a wonderful moistness. 
        Everyone loves this!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>275g (10oz) cold baking spread, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>1 large or 2 small clementines (see tips, about 125g/4Â½ oz), peel left on </li>
        <li>275g (10oz) caster sugar</li>
        <li>275g (10oz) self-raising flour</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>For The Icing</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>250g (9oz) full-fat mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>75g (3oz) butter, softened</li>
        <li>175g (6oz) icing sugar, sifted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>You will need two 20cm (8in) round, loose-bottomed sandwich tins. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, then grease the tins with baking spread and line each base with a disc of baking paper.</li>
        <li>Place the whole clementine(s) with skin on in a pan of water and cover with a lid. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 30-40 minutes until soft. Leave to cool, then slice into quarters and remove any pips or bits of pith. Roughly chop the flesh and peel to a pulp and transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Measure the baking spread, sugar and flour into a bowl and add the eggs. Beat together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then stir in all but 1 tablespoon of clementine pulp. Divide the mixture into the tins and level the tops.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for about 30-35 minutes until well risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool in the tins until cold enough to handle, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool down completely. Peel off the lining paper from each sponge (see tips).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the icing. Whisk the mascarpone, butter and icing sugar together until smooth and fluffy, then stir in the reserved clementine pulp.</li>
        <li>Place one sponge on a serving plate and spread over half the icing, then sandwich together with the second sponge and spread the remaining icing on top.</li>
    </ol>
