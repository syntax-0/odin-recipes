    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This honey sriracha chicken is hands-down one of the best meals 
        I’ve ever made that I consider better than what you can get at a restaurant.
         There’s no heavy oil, no extra fat, no preservatives, no nothing extra.
          Just chicken, sauce, and spice. Make it next time you want 
          Asian-style take out and see if you agree with me!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Corn starch</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Cooked rice for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, get out a small or medium saucepan, and combine 1 cup of water, the sriracha, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and honey and stir it all together. Then, bring the sauce mixture to a boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>While the honey sriracha sauce is cooking, whisk together 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and the remaining 2 tablespoons of water together until the corn starch is dissolved. Add the slurry to the sauce pan and stir it all together until the sauce begins to thicken. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Next, add the diced chicken and 1/3 cup of cornstarch to a large plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it all around to give the chicken a good coating. Drizzle a large pan or skillet with oil over medium heat. Add the coated chicken to the oil and sauté it until it’s browned and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the chicken and stir it all around to coat every piece.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with crushed pepper flakes if desired and serve over warm rice.</li>
    </ol>
